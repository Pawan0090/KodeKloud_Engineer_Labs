#The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repo /opt/cluster.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.

#Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, add/commit the file and push to master branch.

First Step - SSH natasha@ststor01
password - 
sudo su 
password- 

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
ls -ltr 

cp /tmp/index.html 

#now go to tmp folder is the root directory check go inside the tmp folder and check the index.html file, once u inside the tmp folder now initilize the folder 

git init 
git add index.html 
git commit -m ".html file commited"

now we need to push to origin master 

git push origin master 

Thank you :)
